  # Boarding Product is specifically for resellers who onboard merchants to resell their services to merchants and help integrate REST API into their systems.  The Boarding API is designed to simplify and streamline the onboarding process of merchants by enabling administrators and developers to: 1. Enable and Configure Products: The API helps in adding new products to an existing organization and configuring them to suit specific needs. 2. Update Merchant Information: The API allows for updating an organization&#39;s information efficiently. 3. Manage Payment Integration: It provides templates for secure payment integration and management.
