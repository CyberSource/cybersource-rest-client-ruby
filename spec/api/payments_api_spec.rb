  # unit tests for create_payment
  # Process a Payment
  # A payment authorizes the amount for the transaction. There are a number of supported payment features, such as E-commerce and Card Present - Credit Card/Debit Card, Echeck, e-Wallets, Level II/III Data, etc..  A payment response includes the status of the request. It also includes processor-specific information when the request is successful and errors if unsuccessful. See the [Payments Developer Guides Page](https://developer.cybersource.com/docs/cybs/en-us/payments/developer/ctv/rest/payments/payments-intro.html).  Authorization can be requested with Capture, Decision Manager, Payer Authentication(3ds), and Token Creation.
