  # Generate Capture Context
  # This API is used to generate the Capture Context data structure for the Microform Integration.  Microform is a browser-based acceptance solution that allows a seller to capture payment information is a secure manner from their website.  For more information about Flex Microform transactions, see the [Flex Developer Guides Page](https://developer.cybersource.com/api/developer-guides/dita-flex/SAFlexibleToken.html). For examples on how to integrate Flex Microform within your webpage please see our [GitHub Flex Samples](https://github.com/CyberSource?q&#x3D;flex&amp;type&#x3D;&amp;language&#x3D;) This API is a server-to-server API to generate the capture context that can be used to initiate instance of microform on a acceptance page.  The capture context is a digitally signed JWT that provides authentication, one-time keys, and the target origin to the Microform Integration application.
