    # Grand total for the order. This value cannot be negative. You can include a decimal point (.), but no other special characters. CyberSource truncates the amount to the correct number of decimal places.  **Note** For CTV, FDCCompass, Paymentech processors, the maximum length for this field is 12.  **Important** Some processors have specific requirements and limitations, such as maximum amounts and maximum field lengths.  If your processor supports zero amount authorizations, you can set this field to 0 for the authorization to check if the card is lost or stolen.   #### Card Present Required to include either this field or `orderInformation.lineItems[].unitPrice` for the order.  #### Invoicing / Pay By Link Required for creating a new invoice or payment link.  #### PIN Debit Amount you requested for the PIN debit purchase.
