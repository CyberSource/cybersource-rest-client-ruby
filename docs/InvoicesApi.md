# **create_invoice**
> InvoicingV2InvoicesPost201Response create_invoice(create_invoice_request)

Create a New Invoice

The invoicing product enables you to bill any customer with an email address and accept digital payments securely from any connected device. You can either use the system generated email or use the invoice payment link in your own communication. You can add discounts and taxes for the entire invoice or for each line item. To customize the invoice to match your brand see [Invoice Settings](https://developer.cybersource.com/api-reference-assets/index.html#invoicing_invoice-settings_update-invoice-settings). The invoice payment page uses Unified Checkout to process the payments.

# load the gem
